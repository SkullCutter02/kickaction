          Kick Action impacts its members throughout democratising self-learned
          empowerment with the aim of leveraging spiritual equality and the
          worth members attach to themselves. In addition, Kick Action equips
          its members with the ability to harness their mental state, improving
          wellbeing.

          <h1>Current Impact</h1>
          <p>
            The martial arts was historically founded on combating oppression
            and spiritually leveraging practitioners. For example, Taekwondo was
            established and invented by Koreans during Japanâ€™s annexation.
            Karate was born in the Okinawa Islands as a form of self-defense, at
            a time when weapons were banned by invading Japanese forces. Such
            spiritual empowerment is much needed by marginalised community
            members, who endure a dominant sense of inequality in the resources
            they can access and the level of discrimination they face. Kick
            Action democratises the resource of the martial arts, throughout
            technology, filmmaking, and engineering, and offers it in a way that
            emphasizes wellbeing, confidence, and self-learned empowerment.

          <h1>Potential Impact</h1>
          <p>
            Kick Action aims to extrapolate its values to provide
            inequality-addressing spiritual empowerment to a wider community.
            Kick Action believes that, throughout the tight-knit community of
            domestic workers it has created, spiritually empowering activities
            or skills beyond the martial arts, such as visual arts or public
            speaking, can be democratised as well. Kick Action also aims to make
            such resources accessible for marginalised communities beyond the
            domestic worker community and start venturing out to refugees, other
            ethnic groups, and more.
