          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>
            Kick Action connects students’ passions in the martial arts, digital
            arts, filmmaking, engineering, and technology to democratise
            self-learned spiritual and social empowerment for marginalised
            communities. Notably, Kick Action initiated the first student-led
            self defence program, as well as the first domestic worker martial
            arts performance in Hong Kong.

            The martial arts were historically founded on combating oppression
            and spiritually leveraging practitioners. For example, Taekwondo was
            established and invented by Koreans during Japan’s annexation.
            Karate was born in the Okinawa Islands as a form of self-defense, at
            a time when weapons were banned by invading Japanese forces. Such
            spiritual empowerment is much needed by marginalised community
            members, who endure a dominant sense of inequality in the resources
            they can access and the level of discrimination they face. The
            martial arts’s emphasis on developing control of the mind and body
            is another catalyst for such spiritual empowerment, given
            self-discipline is one of its most prominent principles. Kick Action
            democratises the resource of the martial arts, throughout
            technology, filmmaking, and engineering, and offers it in a way that
            emphasizes wellbeing, confidence, and self-learned empowerment.

            To achieve equality, one must see oneself as an autonomous person
            capable of controlling one’s destiny. Martial Arts provides the
            physical and spiritual tools to do this through the mechanisms used
            to tackle SDG 3, which allow for reduced inequalities and the
            addressing of SDG 10.

          <p>
            Kick Action also addresses SDG 5 given that the martial arts is
            viewed as a skill that is supposed to be possessed by men, because
            of its inherent violence, and the majority of domestic workers being
            women.
